# Emotion in Motion: Analyzing Sentiments of Movie Reviews 

## Overview

This project is a natural language processing (NLP) based sentiment analysis model that classifies movie reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset used for this project is "IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis" which is available on Kaggle.

The objective of this project is to create a model that can analyze the sentiment of movie reviews and categorize them as either positive, negative, or neutral. The model is built using Python and utilizes NLP techniques to process and classify the reviews.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is "IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis" which is a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB. The dataset contains an even number of positive and negative reviews, and each review is labeled as either positive or negative.

The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews.

## Methodology

The sentiment analysis model is built using Python and NLP techniques. The steps involved in the model building process are:

- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw text data is preprocessed to remove any noise and irrelevant information. This involves steps such as removing stop words, converting all text to lowercase, and removing special characters.

- **Feature Extraction**: The preprocessed text data is then converted into a set of numerical features that can be used for classification. In this project, the bag-of-words model is used for feature extraction.

- **Model Building**: A classification model is built using the extracted features. In this project, the model used is a **TBD_MODEL_NAME** classifier.

- **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
